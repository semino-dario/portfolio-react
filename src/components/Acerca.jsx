                    My name is Dar√≠o Semino, and I'm from Argentina. I became interested in web development in late 2021. I took several courses and worked on personal and professional projects, with a primary focus on Frontend development using React. Additionally, I possess basic knowledge of Backend technologies such as Node.js, MongoDB, and SQL. You can find examples of the projects I've worked on here.

                    I also love literature, philosophy and learning languages. Besides Spanish, I'm fluent in English and French.
